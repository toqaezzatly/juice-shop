# Forged Coupon
## Challenge Overview
**Title**: Forged Coupon  
**Category**: Cryptography  
**Difficulty**: 6/6

This challenge revolves around reverse engineering. To solve it, you need to figure out which algorithm is used to create discount coupons and exploit this by forging a valid coupon to use in the Juice Shop.

## Tools
- **CyberChef**: A powerful tool for encoding/decoding and cryptography operations.  
- **Cryptii**: An online encoder/decoder that supports various encoding algorithms, including Base85 (Z85).

## Solution
To solve this challenge, the `~/ftp` directory must already be accessible. Once you have access, you should explore the following files:


### 1. Access the Encrypted Coupons:
- File: `http://localhost:3000/ftp/coupons_2013.md.bak%2500.md`  
  This file contains the encrypted coupons. Below is an example of the encrypted coupon codes:

  ```
  n<MibgC7sn
  mNYS#gC7sn
  o*IVigC7sn
  k#pDlgC7sn
  o*I]pgC7sn
  n(XRvgC7sn
  n(XLtgC7sn
  k#*AfgC7sn
  q:<IqgC7sn
  pEw8ogC7sn
  pes[BgC7sn
  l}6D$gC7ss
  ```

### 2. Investigate the `package.json` File:
- File: `http://localhost:3000/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md`  
  By checking this file, you can inspect the projectâ€™s dependencies to identify the algorithm used for encoding the coupons. In this case, the relevant entry is:
  
  ```json
  "z85": "~0.0"
  ```

  This indicates that **Z85**, which is a Base85 encoding library for Node.js, is being used to encode the coupons.

### 3. Decode the Coupons:
- Use tools like **CyberChef** or **Cryptii** to decode the encrypted coupon codes using the Z85 decoding method. Once decoded, you can use the forged coupon codes within the Juice Shop to complete the challenge.

WE ARE DONE!!

## Remediation
&rarr; Use more secure method that is not easily predicted and reversed.

 &rarr; files such as ```package.json``` should not be that exposed to client side.
