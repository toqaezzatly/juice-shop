# Juice Shop Write-up: Imaginary Challenge

## Challenge Overview

**Title:** Imaginary Challenge  
**Category:** Cryptographic Issues  
**Difficulty:** (6/6)

The "Imaginary Challenge" in OWASP Juice Shop presents a conceptual challenge that pushes you to understand the environment and utilize creative problem-solving approaches.

## Tools Used

- **Web Browser**: To interact with Juice Shop.
- **Code Review**: For analyzing files such as `package.json` to discover dependencies and configurations.

## Methodology and Solution

### Step 1: Initial Exploration

The challenge itself is somewhat abstract, which led me to investigate the infrastructure of Juice Shop, focusing specifically on how challenges are typically validated. In this case, I focused on understanding the mechanics behind **ContinueCodes**, which Juice Shop uses to validate challenge completions.

### Step 2: Reviewing `package.json`

Upon reviewing `package.json`, I found a dependency on `hashid`. This library is used for encoding and decoding hash-like identifiers, which gave a clue that it could be relevant for generating or verifying `ContinueCodes`.

### Step 3: Research and External References

After some exploration, I turned to community write-ups and documentation. It became apparent that the challenge once relied on the functionality provided by `hashid`, but that tool has since undergone changes. Originally, `hashid` had an online demonstration that allowed encoding with a default salt to generate a hash from a number (such as 999), which was used to generate a valid `ContinueCode`.

### Step 4: Theoretical Approach

The expected solution would have been:

- Use the `hashid` encoder (with a default salt) to encode the number **999**.
- This would generate a valid `ContinueCode`.
- Apply the code through a PUT request to:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/rest/continue-code/apply/{ContinueCode}
  ```
  where `{ContinueCode}` would be the result of the `hashid` encoding.

However, the online demo for `hashid` is no longer available, and the challenge itself is not fully documented, making this more of a theoretical approach.

## Solution Explanation

This challenge illustrates the potential risks of using default values in tools, especially when they are deployed in security-critical environments. Keeping default values in such settings can expose systems to vulnerabilities.

## Remediation

- **Avoid Default Settings**: Always customize default values when using security tools or libraries to reduce risk.

## Impact

- **Vulnerability**: Potential exposure of sensitive information or functionality through predictable default values.
- **Exploitability**: Attackers can use public tools or predictable values to bypass authentication or validation mechanisms.

## Vulnerability Assessment

- **Severity Score**: High (8.1/10)  
- **Impact Score**: High due to the potential for compromised functionality, especially if the system relies on default settings for security mechanisms.
